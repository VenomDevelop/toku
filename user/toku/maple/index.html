<p>If you are reading this after Feburary 22nd, 2026. I am dead. Don't worry about me, I am okay with this. The reason for the creation of this final page is that I will not be able to finish Toku Maple (Version 3). Below are two links to parts of Toku Maple that I worked on. They are both broken/incomplete, but if I don't upload them here nobody will ever see them. Thank you for visiting and thank you for supporting Toku during its life. Goodbye.</p>

<p>These two pages are meant to be merged together, but were developed seperately.</p>
